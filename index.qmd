These pages are put together using [quarto](https://quarto.org), which is designed for scholarly purposes. 

A big advantage over wordpress is that it doesn't require extensive server infrastructure: the output is 'static' html and any interactive stuff runs in the browser. This makes hosting much simpler. 

It is also simple to feed content: it basically consumes text files, and these are easy to manage collaboratively through git.

    "text": "Abstract\nIntroductory overview: setting the agenda regarding getting ‘beyond ethics’ in critical thinking about ML, in favour of the necessity of developing wider interdisciplinary and structural understandings of AI/ML. Establishing music as an exemplary domain for thinking through these issues, and introducing the MusAI research program’s attempts to develop critical accounts of AI and music, and this course as a key experimental step in our work. A first lens on these issues is through recent debates on ‘AI and culture’, drawing out, via a focus on recommender systems, how culture gets into ML in several distinct ways. From this to the question of how ML applications configure human users, employing ideas from Science and Technology Studies (STS) – and asking: could it be otherwise?\n\n\nCore Readings\nBorn, G.

    "text": "Abstract\nHow does ML conceptualize the objects it models, such as ‘music’ in music information retrieval? Through the question of musical genre – as a particular kind of musical object – we can see radical reductions in how music is often modelled. This has epistemological consequences for what these models can tell us in research, but also quite possibly ontological consequences if – as some argue – models of social and cultural phenomena, such as music or genre, do not merely describe or predict but are performatively changing the very thing they model.\n\n\nCore Readings\nGreen, Owen, Bob L.

It questions whether AI, as a socio-technical assemblage always embedded in its larger cultural and historical contexts, is a coherent object that can be decolonised. Using the Arabic music industries based out of the UAE and Egypt, as well as Anghami, a Beirut-based music streaming service, as case studies, it demonstrates how the Arabic music industry operationalises AI in ways that both challenge and uphold relations of power within the region and beyond. Most broadly, it shows the limitations of decolonising AI even when starting from the epistemologies of listeners and musicians in the global South.\n\n\nCore Readings\nSprengel, Darci. ‘Can AI Be Decolonised?: Notes from the Arabic Music Industry’ (forthcoming 2025).\nBorn, Georgina. ‘Diversifying MIR: Knowledge and Real-World Challenges, and New Interdisciplinary Futures’.

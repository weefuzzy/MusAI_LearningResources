title: "ML, Public Value, and Institutional and Design Alternatives: the Case of Music Recommender Systems" 
---

# Abstract

With ideas around political economy, value and the user in hand, we venture beyond this to consider the limits of personalization as a paradigm, and introduce ideas of public value. Focus on a case study of a combined conceptual-and-technical intervention: a new metric for recommender systems conceived around notions of public value.

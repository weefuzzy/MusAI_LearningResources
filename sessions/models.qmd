title: "The Objects of ML "
---

# Abstract

How does ML conceptualize the objects it models, such as ‘music’ in music information retrieval? Through the question of musical genre – as a particular kind of musical object – we can see radical reductions in how music is often modelled. This has epistemological consequences for what these models can tell us in research, but also quite possibly ontological consequences if – as some argue – models of social and cultural phenomena, such as music or genre, do not merely describe or predict but are performatively changing the very thing they model.
